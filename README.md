# Mexico Drug Traffic Activities

## Info
The analysis that we are going to carry out concerns the citations of the Mexican cartels on the Google search engine, in the news section, between 1990 and 2010. The objectives of the investigation are to understand which of the cartels taken into account are more active during that period of time and in which states of the Mexican Federation have exerted greater influence. These results will be compared with the information available on the historical context, in order to arrive at more plausible explanations of the reality analyzed.

In the final phase, we will try to organize our results to obtain a network of meetings between the individual cartels, in order to reconstruct a hierarchy of importance.
